                <h1><b> Our Story </b></h1>
                <p> Founded in 2016 by Kirk Griffin Tan, Korbie's Kitchen began as a humble food truck, serving up delicious, handcrafted meals to local communities. What started with a passion for cooking and a dream to share great food has blossomed into a beloved restaurant known for its commitment to quality and flavor.
                    From our early days serving wagyu beef burgers and gourmet hotdogs curbside, to expanding into a full-service restaurant, our journey has been fueled by a love for creating memorable dining experiences. Each recipe is crafted with care, using the freshest ingredients sourced locally whenever possible.
                    Today, Korbie's Kitchen stands as a testament to our dedication to food excellence and customer satisfaction. We invite you to join us on this culinary adventure and taste the passion in every bite.</p>
